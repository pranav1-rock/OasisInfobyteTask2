# 🚌 Online Reservation System - Java

This is a simple **console-based reservation system** built in Java as part of my internship with [Oasis Infobyte](https://oasisinfobyte.com) under the **OIBSIP Java Development Internship**.

The system allows users to **log in, reserve a seat, cancel a reservation**, and view ticket details — simulating basic functionality of a ticket booking interface.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ User login authentication (username & password)
- 📝 Reserve a seat (input name, age, train/bus number, etc.)
- ❌ Cancel an existing reservation
- 📄 View booking summary
- 🔐 Basic file-based data storage (optional)

## 💡 How It Works

1. The user logs in using a predefined username and password.
2. Once logged in, a menu displays options:
   - Reserve a ticket
   - Cancel a ticket
   - View reservation
   - Exit
3. The user selects an option, and the system performs the operation accordingly.
